      Never been on a ski holiday?
      <br />
      Here are 5 reasons why you should... ‚õ∑Ô∏è
      <br />
    </h1>
    <div class="content">

     



      <h2>
        From learning a new sport, to seeing some of the most breathtaking views
        in the world, a ski holiday really has something for everyone. Here are
        my top 5 reasons why you should switch from the sunny beach to the snowy
        slopes.
      </h2>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> 1. Beat those January Blues ‚ùÑÔ∏è </strong>
        </li>
        <p>
          It is normal to feel a bit down after all the festivities of Christmas
          are over. So why not give yourself something to look forward too, like
          a week long trip away with family or friends in a winter wonderland.
          With activities such as huskey rides, sleding, and ice-skating, you'll
          be able to find something for everyone. Let the holiday countdown
          begin!
        </p>

        <li>
          <strong> 2. Exercise in the great outdoors üèîÔ∏è </strong>
        </li>
        <p>
          It is easy to hibernate during those gloomy winter days, but skiing
          and snowboarding is a great way to get you outside, learn a new skill
          and connect with nature . Vitamin D isn‚Äôt always easy to find come the
          winter-time, but skiing all day will have you soaking up those winter
          rays, breathing in that fresh mountain air and getting some postcard
          perfect views. Although it is snowy, don‚Äôt forget your sunscreen
          (unless you <em>really</em> want to rock the goggle tan look!)
        </p>

          width="500"
        />

        <li><strong> 3. Food, glorious (Mountain) food! üßÄ </strong></li>
        <p>
          With all that exercise and outdoor air, you will find yourself
          extremely hungry come your last run of the day. Luckily, there will be
          an abundance of mountain huts that will satisfy your needs. Get ready
          to gorge on fondues, Tiroler grostl, schnitzels, hot chocolate,
          strudel... the list goes on and on!

        <li><strong> 4. It's good to laugh üéø </strong></li>
        <p>
          The biggest fear of skiing is making a fool of yourself. Holidays are
          meant to be fun, not painful right? Tuition is the best way to ensure
          you are safe and confident whilst on the busy slopes. Whilst, I cannot
          deny that you will probably fall over at some point, you will learn
          how to do so safely and in control. Even the most professional looking
          geezers fall (if anything, they fall more than most) Trust me, no one
          is looking at you ski. The only thing that will be bruised, is your
          ego, so keep it light hearted and be sure to bring a go pro to laugh
          those moments!
        </p>

        <li><strong> 5. Apre ski, Apre ski, Apre ski üçª </strong></li>
        <p>
          Get ready for oompah bands, lederhosens and some interesting covers of
          your favourite songs. The Apre bar really be the star of the show.
          After a full morning of carving the slopes, you can enjoy an evening
          of drinks, singing and dancing on the tables. It isn‚Äôt a proper ski
          holiday until you have attended a high-altitude party- plus, your
          beers will have no problem staying cold. Need I go on? If you are sold
          on an Apre Ski heavy holiday, best sure to do some research as to
          which ski resort has the best Apre scene.
